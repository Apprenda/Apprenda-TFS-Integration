# Apprenda CI/CD for TFS and VSTS

Apprenda can be easily integrated into the Visual Studio Team Services and Team Foundation Server CI/CD ecosystem whether you are leveraging Workflow-style builds as supported in Team Foundation Server 2013 and later, or the newer Task based builds as supported in Visual Studio Team Services (Visual Studio Online) and Team Foundation Server 2015 and 2017.
