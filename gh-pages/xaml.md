Please view this video ahead of time to understand how all the components work together: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQMx9L18nok&list=UUxOozrV-yw676cqdrh4MLoA 

** This integration will work well with TFS 2012 **
For other versions of TFS, you can use the source code in this repo to build your own Build Activity and XAML build extension to use in your build definition. The source code along with the video above should give you most of the details necessary to get started.
