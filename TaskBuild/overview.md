The Apprenda Build Tools extension for Team Foundation Server 2015 and Visual Studio Team Services enables two types of tasks:
*  packaging Visual Studio solutions containing WCF Service projects and ASP.Net website projects into well-formed [Apprenda archives](https://docs.apprenda.com/7-0/creating-app-archives).

* deployment of [Apprenda archives](https://docs.apprenda.com/7-0/creating-app-archives) to an [Apprenda Cloud Platform](https://docs.apprenda.com/6-0/introduction)

Detailed configuration instructions are available at the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/apprenda/Apprenda-TFS-Integration/tree/master/2015) for the project.
